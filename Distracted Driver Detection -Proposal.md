# Deep learning classification model to detect the driver state  :
___
> - In this project our task was to get a dataset to build an deep learning classification model,
We chose to analyze a dataset obtained from a kaggle that collects an images for the driver state
The dataset will be obtained from the website below the dataset contains 10 classes each class contains around 2000 images .
